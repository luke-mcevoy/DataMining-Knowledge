Is the following function a proper distance function?

d(x,y) = summation ( (xi - yi)^3 )

No, because a distance metric is a real-valued function d used to measure the similarity between coordinates x,y, and z with properties

1. d(x,y) >= 0, and d(x,z) = 0 iff x=y
2. d(x,y) = d(y,x)
3. d(x,z) <= d(x,y) + d(y,z)

With the provided function, the coordinates (0,1,0) and (0,0,0) compute to:

d(x,y) = (0-0)^3 + (0-1)^3 + (0-0)^3 = -1

This breaks rule 1, that distance can not be negative
